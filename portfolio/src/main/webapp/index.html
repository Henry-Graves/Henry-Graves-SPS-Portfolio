      <p id="border1">I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida.         
         I've lived in Florida for all of my life, but I'm hoping to change that by studying abroad as soon as it's possible.</p>

      <h1>Career</h1>
      <p id="border3">My general career goal is to become a software developer that makes things easier for people to use.
         I am a student in the Google Software Product Sprint program where I am learning relevant tools and 
         languages that will help me get to that point. I am also pursuing work experience through internships.
