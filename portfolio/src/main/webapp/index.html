      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p id="border1">I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida.         
          I was born in Jacksonville and I've lived in Florida for all of my life, but I'm hoping to change that by studying abroad next spring.</p>

      <h1>My Dream App</h1>
      <p>One which makes financial education more accessible and approachable to improve users‚Äô economic mobility.
          I was lucky enough to stumble upon and enjoy personal finance when I was in high school, and I would like
          to help others receive the benefits that are available.
          The cool thing about making an app for this is that its potential reach and effect is far beyond what's
          possible if I stuck to teaching people in 1-on-1s.
      <br>
          After that, maybe I'll make Club Penguin 2.0 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
      <p>Here is some interesting data on American investing habits:</p>
      <div id="chart-container"></div>
      <p>Far less Americans are investing after the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008,
         yet the most basic investment funds (S&P500) have increased 4x since that time.

      <h1>My Mantra</h1>
      <p id = "border1"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0">Just do it</a></p>

      <h1>Career</h1>
      <p id="border2">My general career goal is to become a software developer who makes things easier for people to use.
          I am a student in the Google Software Product Sprint program where I am learning relevant tools,
          languages, and team-based workflows that will help with starting my career. I am also pursuing work experience through internships.
